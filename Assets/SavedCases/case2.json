    "playerGoal": "Achieve a full acquittal for the defendant, proving that he was not responsible for the explosion.",
    "summary": "Luca Ferraro, an experienced warehouse supervisor, stands accused in a criminal trial after a devastating chemical explosion injured five workers and caused significant property damage. The prosecution alleges negligence and possible sabotage linked to missing safety logs and confidential emails about hazardous materials storage. However, ambiguous security footage contradicts some witness accounts while gaps exist in documentation regarding maintenance reports prior to the disaster. The defense must unravel complex procedural issues with evidence handling and argue alternative theories of causation under intense media scrutiny.",
    "shortSummary": "Luca Ferraro is charged with causing a deadly warehouse explosion despite uncertain proof; conflicting witnesses & incomplete records create doubt as you defend him against serious allegations.",
    "evidence": [
      "Security camera shows someone entering restricted area but image is blurred during critical minutes.",
      "Recently replaced machine part logged by technician on day before accident but form only partially completed.",
      "The official safety audit notes discrepancies between real quantities stored versus those recorded four days earlier.",
      "A deleted email thread recovered from server hints at budget-pressure decisions affecting chemical inventory compliance."
