    "title": "The Case of the Château Trespass",
    "playerGoal": "Secure acquittal for the defendant by proving that their entry onto private property was justified or non-criminal under French law.",
    "summary": "In a small town in France, Luc Morel is accused of unlawfully entering and occupying part of Madame Leroy’s historic château grounds. The dispute centers on whether Luc mistakenly relied on ambiguous property boundaries cited in local records when he entered what he believed to be public land. Witness testimony provides conflicting accounts about prior permission given to locals during renovations, plus there are discrepancies within surveillance footage timestamps and maintenance logs attributed to past disputes over access rights.",
    "shortSummary": "Luc Morel faces charges after allegedly trespassing into a restricted section of Madame Leroy's estate due to unclear boundary markings and disputed permissions involving other residents' historical access claims.",
    "evidence": [
      "A faded map showing partially overlapping boundaries between communal land and the privately-owned area.",
      "A letter from 2019 suggesting community members were allowed temporary garden access during repairs but not specifying duration or precise zones involved.",
      "CCTV footage with an unexplained gap at noon—the time alleged trespass began—leaving room for interpretation regarding who approached first."

      "Sophie Leroy, owner of the château since inherited seven years ago: meticulous yet somewhat reserved; she firmly insists Luc violated her privacy without any valid invitation while admitting misunderstandings often occurred about which parts neighbors could cross during external works last year.",
      "Hugo Dubois, longtime municipal staff member who oversaw several repair projects near estate borders: friendly but occasionally vague; claims villagers like Luc were verbally informed some areas might be accessible briefly although such announcements weren't formally documented."
