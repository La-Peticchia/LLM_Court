    "playerGoal": "Obtain an acquittal or secure a reduced sentence for the defendant through skillful legal maneuvering.",
    "summary": "John Cena, a world-famous professional wrestler, is on trial for allegedly murdering sports agent Daniel Foster after a heated post-event argument at Madison Arena. The prosecution claims that CCTV footage captured John leaving the VIP lounge moments before the victim was found dead with blunt force trauma consistent with wrestling techniques. However, ambiguous witness accounts and forensic gaps raise questions about potential motive and opportunity amongst other guests present during the altercation.",
    "shortSummary": "Defend John Cena against murder charges following an arena event confrontation—evidence appears damning but witnesses' statements reveal inconsistencies demanding sharp scrutiny.",
    "evidence": [
      "VIP Lounge video shows blurred figure resembling John departing minutes before time of death.",
      "Bloodied commemorative championship belt found near crime scene left undisturbed; no fingerprints detected.",
      "Several texts sent from John's phone suggest resentment toward Foster but lack clear threats.",
      "An unsigned parking validation ticket in John's jacket pocket ties him to venue yet overlaps timelines confusingly."
