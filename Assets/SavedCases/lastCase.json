    "title": "The Case of the Diamond-Eyed Zucchini Thief",
    "playerGoal": "Obtain full acquittal for the defendant accused of grand theft vegetable with a mysterious diamond connection.",
    "summary": "Clara Mendoza, chef at an exclusive restaurant, is on trial for allegedly stealing a rare zucchini from a private collector’s greenhouse during an event where one guest sported artificial 'diamond eyes.' Security footage shows only indistinct shadows; fingerprints found near the scene do not match Clara. The prosecution claims she had motive to procure unusual ingredients and was seen arguing with the collector earlier that night. Two witnesses offer conflicting observations about who entered and left through back exits amid heavy rain, raising questions about possible accomplices or mistaken identity. The defense must unravel ambiguous clues related to jewel-themed accessories and missing produce while exposing inconsistencies in testimonies.",
    "shortSummary": "Chef Clara Mendoza faces charges over a stolen prized zucchini linked to odd diamond-eyed jewelry. Conflicting witness accounts leave guilt uncertain as evidence remains open-ended.",
    "evidence": [
      "A security tape showing two figures but overly blurred due to glare reflected off someone's jeweled glasses.",

      "A receipt for expensive cosmetic contact lenses labeled ‘Diamond Eyes’, billed anonymously on event day.",
      "Mismatched footprints—one set small in size leading out into rain-soaked grass beside larger boot prints possibly male."

    "witnessDescriptions": [
      "Tall art dealer Sandra Polk wore oversized sunglasses 'diamond eyes' throughout the rainy party; assertive yet evasive when questioned by police, she insists seeing Clara linger nervously outside but admits losing sight after dropping her umbrella among scattered garden tools.",
      "Lorenzo Dray is an introverted botanist employed by Mr. Rubenstein the owner; analytical yet anxious under cross-examination, he recalls hearing muffled voices just before spotting someone leaving—but never positively identified their face beneath wet hoods or observed any clear thief-jewel interaction."
