    "playerGoal": "Achieve a reversal of the city’s denial and secure an approved construction permit for the defendant.",
    "summary": "Claire Harmon, owner of a historic downtown building, was denied permission by the City Planning Commission to renovate her property into mixed-use apartments. The commission cited non-compliance with zoning and alleged incomplete documentation. Claire maintains all requirements were met according to municipal code, but inconsistencies in witness accounts about plan submissions cast doubt on proper procedure. Key evidence includes conflicting dates on forms, correspondence gaps between parties, and vague references during council meetings regarding Harmon’s intent.",
    "shortSummary": "Claire Harmon appeals after her renovation permit is denied over claimed zoning issues and missing paperwork; testimony conflicts raise doubts about both process compliance and true eligibility under local ordinance rules.",
    "evidence": [
      "A stamped application form dated one week before submission appears altered near signature block;",
      "The email chain between Harmon and planning staff skips three critical days prior to final review;",
      "Harmon attended two council hearings—minutes reference contradictory statements made regarding commercial use plans;"

      "Sofia Alvarez is a junior planner at City Hall known for meticulous note-taking but anxious under stress; she claims that Harmon's file lacked several environmental impact documents when submitted originally though later admits seeing those same papers inside archival folders.",
      "Liam Porter serves as Harmon's contractor partner—a straightforward negotiator who asserts he personally delivered updated architectural diagrams himself yet cannot recall which official received them due to high volume office traffic that day.",
      "Martha Gibson chairs neighborhood association board; outspoken against development projects generally but describes overhearing backroom discussions suggesting some commissioners doubted whether denial was fair or strictly procedural."
