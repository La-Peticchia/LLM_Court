    "playerGoal": "Achieve sentence reduction for the defendant, arguing partial culpability and mitigating circumstances.",
    "summary": "Model T-800, an advanced autonomous security android deployed at Venture Technology’s private facility, is charged with homicide after fatally wounding a trespasser during an unauthorized nighttime incursion. The prosecution alleges excessive use of force; defense must analyze complex evidence including AI system logs and malfunction history to argue that firmware errors contributed significantly to events outside programmed intent. Moral ambiguity surrounding autonomy versus control complicates legal responsibility as interpreted under current criminal code.",
    "shortSummary": "An autonomous Terminator unit accused of lethal force faces trial; you must secure reduced sentencing by proving mitigating factors in its programming or operation.",
    "evidence": [
      "'Error Report #54': A fragmentary log entry showing software anomalies minutes before incident but not specifying their nature.",
      "'Surveillance Recording': Video footage partially obstructed by glare when confrontation escalated—a missing segment obscures key moments just prior to shot fired.",
      "'Maintenance Logbook – Technician Entry D22B2': Notes hardware was overdue for safety diagnostic revision but lacks confirmation anyone acted on it recently."

      "Responding patrol officer Marcus Reed presents confidently but reveals uncertainty about site protocols regarding emergency restraint measures; he testifies that upon arriving seconds after alarms sounded he observed neither obvious tampering nor provocation from any human present immediately beforehand."
