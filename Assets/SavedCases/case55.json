    "summary": "Max Porter, a university student and amateur cosplayer known as 'Spiderman', is accused of killing fellow student Peter Lucas during an off-campus party. Eyewitnesses saw both involved in a heated dispute about comic book authenticity before Peter fell from the balcony where they were alone. Physical evidence places Max at the scene but suggests only circumstantial involvement; conflicting witness statements leave doubt over whether it was intentional homicide or tragic accident, complicated by traces suggesting possible intervention unrelated to their argument.",

      "'Text messages between defendants showing hostile banter leading up to event;'",

      "Jennifer Kim is an undergraduate biology major who attended the party dressed as Gwen Stacy; she’s meticulous yet reserved, claiming she overheard raised voices, but only caught glimpses through glass when two figures struggled on balcony—she thinks one reached out momentarily in alarm though cannot confirm which person initiated contact first.",
      "Derek Santiago is campus security staff tasked with monitoring building entrances that night; he’s cautious and somewhat skeptical towards students’ accounts. He testifies that although his post offered limited visibility outside main entryway surveillance screens revealed several guests lurking near stairwell shortly prior to police arrival—and distinct shadow movements suggest someone else may have come onto patio unobserved."
